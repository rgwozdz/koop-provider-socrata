# koop-cli-new-provider

An opinionated koop provider template for [koop-cli](https://github.com/haoliangyu/koop-cli).

This is a fork of [koop-provider-example](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-sample) with several differences:

* Minimal

  This template drops optional files from the original provider example and the developer should start with the simplest provider template.

* No configuration

  This template requires no configuration and it is up to the developer to choose how to configurate it.
